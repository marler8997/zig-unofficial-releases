    - combine std.build and std.build.Builder into std.Build
    - new std.Build.addModule API introduced
    - remove setPreferredReleaseMode and standardReleaseOptions in favor of
      standardOptimizeOption which has a future-proof options parameter.
    - setting target/optimize_mode moved to create function
    - LibExeObjStep deprecated, renamed to CompileStep
    - support for generated C headers with std.Build.addConfigHeader
    - std.Build.Cache now available in std library
